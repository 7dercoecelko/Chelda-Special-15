## What is a Chelada?
     
A Chelada is a simple drink that originated in Mexico. It is also known as a Michelada or a Cerveza Preparada. The name Chelada comes from the Spanish words "chela" (slang for beer) and "helada" (frozen or cold). A Chelada is basically a beer with lime juice and salt, served over ice in a glass with a salted rim. Some people also add Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, or tomato juice to their Cheladas for extra flavor.
     
A Chelada is a refreshing and low-alcohol drink that can be enjoyed anytime of the day. It is especially popular in hot weather, as it helps to quench thirst and cool down. Some people also drink Cheladas as a hangover cure, as the lime juice and salt can help to replenish electrolytes and hydration.
     
## How to Make a Chelda Special 15?
     
A Chelda Special 15 is a twist on the classic Chelada recipe. It uses a Mexican lager beer, such as Corona or Modelo, and adds some Old Bay seasoning to the salted rim. Old Bay is a spice blend that contains celery salt, paprika, black pepper, red pepper, and other spices. It is commonly used to season seafood dishes, such as crab cakes or shrimp boils. Old Bay adds a savory and spicy kick to the Chelda Special 15, making it more flavorful and interesting.
     
To make a Chelda Special 15, you will need the following ingredients:

- 12 ounce Mexican lager beer
- 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) lime juice
- 1 pinch salt
- Ice, for serving
- For the rim: 1 tablespoon each fine sea salt and Old Bay (or tajin)

Here are the steps to make a Chelda Special 15:

1. Mix the fine sea salt and Old Bay (or tajin) in a small plate. Wet the rim of a large glass with lime juice or water, and dip it into the salt mixture.
2. Fill the glass with ice cubes. Pour the lime juice and salt over the ice.
3. Slowly pour the beer into the glass, tilting it slightly to avoid too much foam.
4. Stir gently with a spoon or a straw to mix everything well.
5. Enjoy your Chelda Special 15!
